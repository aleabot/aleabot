Features
========

Aleabot is a Kingdom of Loathing [1] bot. Its main features are rolling dice,
handing out wangs and shooting arrows. Aleabot is written using the
pykol library [2]. Aleabot is designed to be highly configurable, although
adding new commands will require code modification.

Aleabot was written by franz1 (#2272489) and is running on aleabot (#2379422).

Getting started
===============

Requirements:

- Python 2.7 or any later Python 2 version. (Python 2.6 and earlier may work
  but have not been tested. Python 3.0 and later will not work.)

- pykol (see below for instructions)

- A reasonably stable internet connection

- Access to the bot account (or any account, really)

- Operating system should not matter, as long as Python and pykol work.
  The bot has only been tested on Gentoo Linux, however.

How to set up Aleabot:

- Extract (or git clone) the aleabot source code to a directory.

- Switch to that directory and copy aleabot.conf.default to aleabot.conf.

- Edit aleabot.conf: make sure to configure at least the username and password,
  but you will probably want to look at the rest of the options too.

- Download pykol and extract it inside the top aleabot directory (so that
  the pykol source is in aleabot/pykol/src). An easy way to do that is to
  run the command
    "git clone https://github.com/scelis/pykol.git"
  from the top aleabot directory.

  TEMPORARY NOTE

  Aleabot uses the "rollover" state in kol.bot.Bot, which is at the time
  of writing not available in pykol. Clone the following repository instead:
    "git clone https://github.com/aleabot/pykol.git"
  and switch to the rolloverstate branch:
    "cd pykol"
    "git checkout rolloverstate"
    "cd .."

- Run bin/aleabot.py.


Configuration
=============

Most configuration settings should be fairly straightforward and
are documented in aleabot.conf.default.

The configuration file consists of 4 sections:

- auth: Authentication settings. You must supply username and password here.

- bot: Basic bot settings and delays. For example, adjust time_to_sleep to
  change how fast aleabot reacts. All time values in this section are in
  seconds. You can also configure aleabot's logging behaviour in this section.

- limits: The values in this section are designed to prevent abuse of the bot.
  Reduce public roll limits with great caution. Also, "games" is probably
  the only non-clan channel that rolls should ever be allowed in.

- chatter: Everything the bot says is in this section. You may use variables
  (such as %P for the name of the player who sent the request to aleabot)
  in most of the settings here.

  If you want to define multiple values for one settings, of which one
  should be chosen at random each time the setting is needed, define
  "setting_1", "setting_2", "setting_3" etc. instead of "setting" (where
  "setting" is the setting name). See error_bad_syntax in
  aleabot.conf.default for an example.


Using the bot
=============

To roll a die:
/msg aleabot roll xdx in games

To roll privately:
/msg aleabot roll xdx

To roll a die in clan chat (I need a whitelist, and dungeon access for rolling in a dungeon channel):
/msg aleabot roll xdx in clan
/msg aleabot roll xdx in hobopolis
/msg aleabot roll xdx in slimetube
/msg aleabot roll xdx in hauntedhouse

To wang yourself:
/msg aleabot wang
To wang someone else:
/msg aleabot wang <person>
To be hit with a time's arrow:
/msg aleabot arrow
To hit someone else with a time's arrow:
/msg aleabot arrow <person>

To remove a chat effect:
/msg aleabot uneffect wang
/msg aleabot uneffect brr
/msg aleabot uneffect jaw

DICE ROLLING FEATURES

I can roll multiple (separate) dice at once:
/msg aleabot roll 1d10, 1d100, 1d1000 in games

I can do funky math with dice:
/msg aleabot roll (1d3)^(1d3)^(1d3) in games
will give 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 16, 27, 81, 256, 512, 6561, 19683, 134217728 or 7625597484987.

LIMITS

You can only roll dice in public once per minute.

A person can only be wanged up to 3 times a day and arrowed once a day. Also, you can only use the wang function up to 10 times per day and the arrow function once a day.
